## Objection Handling

### "That's too expensive"
**Response**: "Let me show you the value breakdown. This includes a professional backend that would cost ₹15,000 alone if you hired a developer. Plus, you're getting 2 years of hosting included (worth ₹8,000). The actual value is ₹53,000, but I'm offering it at ₹40,000."

### "Can't we use WordPress?"
**Response**: "WordPress sites need monthly hosting (₹1,000-₹2,000), security plugins, and constant updates. This solution has zero ongoing costs and is 10x faster. Plus, WordPress sites get hacked frequently - this is enterprise-grade secure."

### "We already have a website"
**Response**: "Does your current site save appointment requests to a database? Can you see analytics on which services are popular? Does it send you instant email notifications? This isn't just a redesign - it's a complete business intelligence system."

### "We need to think about it"
**Response**: "I understand. Let me set up a demo with the backend working so you can see the appointment system in action. You'll see exactly how it saves you time and brings in more patients."
